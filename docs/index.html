            <p>All the shitty HTML corrected by <a href="https://dev.to/inhuofficial">Inclusivity Hub</a></p>
            <p>Published on the <time datetime="2021-08-08">08 August 2021</time>. Just so you know the date that someone finally got this shit right! (over 7 years!)</p>
            <p><a href="#explanation">(Jump to the footer for an explanation of what is going on here if you don't know!)</a></p>
        </header>  
        <main>
            <section aria-labelledby="accessible-semantic-html">
                <h2 id="accessible-semantic-html">Seriously, none of you can write valid and Accessible HTML?</h2>

                <p><strong>Just a few <em>Semantic</em> <a href="#glossary-html">HTML</a> elements and a tiny bit of <a href="#glossary-aria">WAI-ARIA</a> is all it fucking took to turn your shitty site into a fully accessible one.</strong></p>

                <p>Did any of you even run an automated accessibility checker when you built your sites, no I thought not. Never mind taking the time to learn about accessibility for the <a href="https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2017/02/24/what-we-found-when-we-tested-tools-on-the-worlds-least-accessible-webpage/">60% of errors accessibility checkers can't find.</a></p>

                <p>The web is not inherently accessible as it is built by people and people don't take the time to learn this shit. We have all the tools to make the web accessible, you just have to use them!</p>

                <p>Oh and I fixed the <a href="#glossary-css">CSS</a> so that the critical styles are inlined (which is all of them on a tiny site like this). You know, like you are supposed to.</p> 

                <p>This meant I could add a total of 25 CSS properties (still <a href="https://www.tunetheweb.com/blog/critical-resources-and-the-first-14kb">way less than 14kb</a>, not that you would know why using that as a rough guide for size is important). It gives the site a little bit of visual appeal and structure. Still lightning fast, in fact it is faster than the "perfect" site.</p>

                <p>I did even more things:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I fixed your shitty line spacing, not one of you got that right! Your heading and paragraph spacing were all fucked up</li>
                    <li><em>Now</em> it is nice on all screens, instead of being pressed up against the side on a mobile</li>
                    <li><em>Still</em> looks great in all your shitty browsers, yes even Internet Explorer 7!</li>
                    <li>Still <em>wonâ€™t</em> bleach your fucking eyeballs at night if your modern browser thinks you like dark things. But now the dark theme colours are less boring.</li>
                    <li>The motherfuckerâ€™s <s>still</s> <em>actually</em> accessible to every dick head that visits your site.</li>
                </ul>
